# CONTROL FLOW  
  
## If  
  
**Description:** Inserts a conditional 'If' statement into the procedure.  
  
## Elseif  
  
**Examples:**  
  * If a > 4  
    b = 0  
    Else-if a > 3  
    b = 1.  
  
**Description:** Inserts a conditional 'Else-if' statement, which must be part of a compound conditional 'If' statement. The 'Else-if' statement must directly follow either an 'If' statement or another 'Else-if' statement.  
  
## Else  
  
**Description:** Inserts a conditional 'Else' statement, which must be part of a compound conditional 'If' statement. The 'Else' statement must directly follow either an 'If' statement or another 'Else-if' statement.  
  
## Foreach  
  
**Description:** Inserts a 'For-each' loop statement. The body of the loop can be executed zero or more times.  
  
## While  
  
**Description:** Inserts a 'While' loop statement. The body of the loop can be executed zero or more times.  
  
## Break-loop  
  
**Description:** Inserts a 'Break-loop' statement into the body of either a 'For-each' loop or a 'While' loop. When the 'Break-loop' is executed, execution will break out of the loop and procedure to the next line of code immediatley after the loop statement. The 'Break-loop' statement is typically nested inside a conditional 'If' statement.  
  
## Continue-loop  
  
**Description:** Inserts a 'Continue-loop' statement into the body of either a 'For-each' loop or a 'While' loop. When the 'Continue-loop' is executed, execution will skips the subsequent lines of code in the loop body and continue with the next iteration of the loop. The 'Continue-loop' statement is typically nested inside a conditional 'If' statement.  
  
## Return  
  
**Description:** Inserts a 'Return' statement into either the body of a procedure or the body of a local function.  
  
## Exit  
  
**Description:** ...  
  
## Bypass-node  
  
**Description:** ...
